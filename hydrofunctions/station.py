    Improvements:
        make each subclass store its own dictionary, parent class can combine.
        only store weakrefs to the objects, so that they can be garbage
        collected. maybe weakvaluedictionary.

            should be None if stateCd or countyCd are not None.

            can either be 'iv' or 'dv' for instantaneous or daily data.

        start_date (str):
           should take on the form yyyy-mm-dd

            should take on the form yyyy-mm-dd

        stateCd (str):
            a valid two-letter state postal abbreviation. Default is None.

            a valid county abbreviation. Default is None.

            NWIS parameter code. Default is stream discharge '00060'
