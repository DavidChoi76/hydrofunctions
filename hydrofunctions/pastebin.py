pastebin.py

This file is not meant to be included in any merge with Develop!
As the name implies, this is just a dump where I can store useful code
from my notebooks in one central location for later development.

1) Paste new code from the notebooks into this module.

2) If I choose to develop some code further:
    - move it into an official module
    - add tests
    - add documentation & example notebooks
    ==> OPTION 1: create a branch off of paste-bin with a descriptive name
            - delete this module (pastebin.py)
            - merge the new branch with the Develop branch
            - Keep adding stuff to the paste-bin branch; repeat
    ==> OPTION 2: Create a branch off of Develop
            - Cut and paste new files and modules from paste-bin branch into the new branch
            - Keep adding stuff to the paste-bin branch; repeat

def QQplot(A, B, scale='log', ylabel='Discharge', symbol='.'):
    """Creates a QQ chart from two series of discharges with the same time index.
    Args:
        Qdf (dataframe): a dataframe of discharge values.
            * Values should be arranged in columns
            * No sorting necessary
            * Rows do not need an index
            * If more than one column, each column will be added as a\
                separate color to the chart.
            * Only include columns with discharge values; no metadata
        xscale ('logit' | 'linear'): Type of x scale for plotting probabilities
            default is 'logit', so that each standard deviation is nearly the
            same distance on the x scale. 'linear' is the other option.
        yscale ('log' | 'linear'): The type of y scale for plotting discharge.
            Default is 'log'.
        ylabel (str, default: 'Discharge'): The label for the Y axis.
        xlabel (not implemented)
        symbol (str, '.' | ','): formatting symbol for points.
            * point: '.' (default)
            * pixel point: ','
            * circle: 'o'
            * triangle up: '^'
            See https://matplotlib.org/api/markers_api.html for full list of
            point formatters.
    Returns:
        fig (matplotlib.figure.Figure):
            a matplotlib figure. This will plot immediately in a Jupyter
            notebook if the command '%matplotlib inline' was previously issued.
            The figure may also be altered after it is returned.
        ax (matplotlib.axes.Axes):
            a matplotlib chart. This may be altered after it is returned.
