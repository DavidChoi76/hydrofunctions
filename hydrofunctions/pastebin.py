pastebin.py

This file is not meant to be included in any merge with Develop!
As the name implies, this is just a dump where I can store useful code
from my notebooks in one central location for later development.

1) Paste new code from the notebooks into this module.

2) If I choose to develop some code further:
    - move it into an official module
    - add tests
    - add documentation & example notebooks
    ==> OPTION 1: create a branch off of paste-bin with a descriptive name
            - delete this module (pastebin.py)
            - merge the new branch with the Develop branch
            - Keep adding stuff to the paste-bin branch; repeat
    ==> OPTION 2: Create a branch off of Develop
            - Cut and paste new files and modules from paste-bin branch into the new branch
            - Keep adding stuff to the paste-bin branch; repeat
