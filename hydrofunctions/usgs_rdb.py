def field_meas(site):
    """Load USGS field measurements of stream discharge into a Pandas dataframe

    Args:
        site (str):
            The gage ID number for the site.

    Returns:
        a dataframe. Each row represents an observation on a given date of
        river conditions at the gage by USGS personnel. Values are stored in
        columns, and include the measured stream discharge, channel width,
        channel area, depth, and velocity. These data can be used to create a
        rating curve, to estimate the gage height for a discharge of zero, and
        to get readings of water velocity.

    NOTES:
        To plot a rating curve, use:
            `output.plot(x='gage_height_va', y='discharge_va', kind='scatter')`

        Rating curves are typically plotted with the indepedent variable,
        gage_height, plotted on the Y axis.

    Discussion:
        The USGS operates over 8,000 stream gages around the United States and
        territories. Each of these sensors records the depth, or 'stage' of the
        water. In order to translate this stage data into stream discharge, the
        USGS staff creates an empirical relationship called a 'rating curve'
        between the river stage and stream discharge. To construct this curve,
        the USGS personnel visit all of the gage every one to eight weeks, and
        measure the stage and the discharge of the river manually.

        The `field_meas()` function returns all of the field-collected data for
        this site. You can use these data to create your own rating curve or to
        read the notes about local conditions.

        The `rating_curve()` function returns the most recent 'expanded shift-
        adjusted' rating curve constructed for this site.
